                <h3>NPO</h3>
                <p>The reason for NPO is to provide benefits to the society and give those who lost hope a chance to regain hope. NPOs have separate entity status, meaning they have their own existence, can enter contracts, and are responsible for their obligations. Additionally, NPOs can provide assets or income to individuals only as fair compensation.</p>

                <h3>NPO</h3>
                <p>NPOs cannot be political, which is why many of them maintain a non-partisan tone in their communication. They have tax-exempt status granted by the IRS due to their contribution to a social cause and public benefit.</p>
